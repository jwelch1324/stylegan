# StyleGAN in PyTorch

This project is a re implementation of the original StyleGAN architecture in pytorch https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan

Anyone is free to use or adapt this code however they wish

# Update 2022
There are other implementations that are more rigorously tested now available as part of the pytorch lighting zoo -- if you want to use a StyleGAN architecture I recommend you go there
